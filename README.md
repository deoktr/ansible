# Ansible

Linux hardening Ansible roles for Debian and Arch based Linux servers and workstations.

The main idea of those roles is to control everything that is going on the server, for example: not a single port should be opened if it's not needed and not in use, not a single package should be installed if it's not needed. Also every roles should work independently of each other, I should always be able to configure ONLY ONE package, for example if I only want to configure chrony I should be able to WITHOUT having to install other packages. Ansible managed files should have the appropriate header placed on top.

## Usage

Run the playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook --ask-vault-password -i inventory.yaml play.yml
```

Run locally:

```bash
sudo ansible-playbook --connection=local --inventory 127.0.0.1, --limit 127.0.0.1 play.yml
```

## Variables

To add variables create a file called `all` in `group_vars`:

```bash
mkdir group_vars
touch group_vars/all
```

## Create vaulted var

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt_string
```

Copy the output inside [group_vars/all](./group_vars/all).

## Lint playbooks

```bash
ansible-lint roles
```

Note that the configuration for the linter is located in [.config/ansible-lint.yaml](./.config/ansible-lint.yml).

### Clean

```bash
docker rm ubuntu_sshd_container
docker rmi ubuntu_sshd_image
```

## Tags

Use tags `I` with number going form `I0` to `I4`, 0 being the less impactfull and 4 the most.

Example: MOTD is set to `I0` because it's impact is non-existent. But UFW is set to `I4` because if set up without allowing network services (opening ports) this can break a server.

## TODO

-   If any package is not up to date update it and restart it
-   Add option to disable user instead of deleting
-   Remove every file permissions for non-root users on logs, or at least write
-   Remove debian_chroot from .bashrc
-   Run app in docker on the server
-   Kill all process of a user we want to delete
-   Find a solution for when rebooting if the ssh port changes
-   Maybe don't change the ssh port ?
-   Control the presence of SSH server with a variable
-   Add tag 'security'
-   Variable to enable IPv6
-   Add aide role
-   Add logwatch role: https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-role-logwatch
-   Add zabbix role: https://github.com/robertdebock/ansible-playbook-zabbix
-   Make reboot optional !

## Debian

On Debian there is a few things you'll need to do before starting the Ansible script, you'll need to install sudo, add it to the user, reboot for the change to take effect.

```bash
apt install sudo
usermod -aG sudo $USER
reboot
```

Then you can start the Ansible script, it will stop after changing the Ansible user password, update it in inventory and restart it.

Or you can directly start it from root user via SSH.
