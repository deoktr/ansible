# /etc/pam.d/common-password - password-related modules common to all services
#
# This file is included from other service-specific PAM config files,
# and should contain a list of modules that define the services to be
# used to change user passwords.  The default is pam_unix.
#

password	optional		pam_echo.so file=/usr/share/doc/good-password.txt
password	required		pam_pwquality.so retry=4 enforce_for_root
password	required		pam_pwhistory.so use_authtok remember={{ pam_pwhistory_remember }}
# here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)
password	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so obscure use_authtok try_first_pass remember=5
# here's the fallback if no module succeeds
password	requisite		pam_deny.so
# prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;
# this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code
# since the modules above will each just jump around
password	required		pam_permit.so
# and here are more per-package modules (the "Additional" block)
# end of pam-auth-update config
